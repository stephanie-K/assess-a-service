# Assess a service

This is a personal project. I'm experimenting with a tool to have various options to assess a service using existing frameworks and tools publicly available:

- [GOV.UK Service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)
- [Scottish Government Service standard](https://www.gov.scot/publications/digital-scotland-service-standard/)
- [Good service scale](https://good.services/the-good-services-scale) (by Lou Downe)
- [Ethics assessement](https://spotify.design/article/investigating-consequences-with-our-ethics-assessment) (by spotify.Design)


I have [a blog post about it](https://blog.chezleskrus.com/2020/11/15/assess-a-service/).
